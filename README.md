# Conway-s-Game-of-Life :space_invader:
Recreation of Conway's Game of life using Java.

### Overview
The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. 


### *Rules*
Conway's game of life has a few simple rules that are checked every "generation"
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.
- Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
- All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.

### *how to use*
To set the initial state of the board simply click on a cell in the grid to set it to "alive", reclick if you want to return the cell to its initial state. After selecting the desired cells to "alive" you can start the game by pressing "S". To pause the game you can press "P". To clear the board and reset the game you can press "C". At any point during the game you can click on the board to add new cells although this might be hard when it is not paused as it runs relatively fast.


#### what I would like to add in the future 
In the future I will add buttons to start pause and clear the board.
A feature that allows the user to zoom in and out of the board (allowing for a bigger board and many more cool patterns).
A button that can slow down or increase the speed of the game.
